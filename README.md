# PassiveDNS::Client

This rubygem queries the following Passive DNS databases: 

* BFK.de
* CIRCL
* DNSDB (FarSight)
* Mnemonic
* PassiveDNS.cn (Qihoo 360 Technology Co.,Ltd)
* PassiveTotal
* RiskIQ
* TCPIPUtils
* VirusTotal

Passive DNS is a technique where IP to hostname mappings are made by recording the answers of other people's queries.  

There is a tool included, pdnstool, that wraps a lot of the functionality that you would need.

Please note that use of any passive DNS database is subject to the terms of use of that passive DNS database.  Use of this script in violation of their terms is strongly discouraged.  Also, please do not add any obfuscation to try to work around their terms of service.  If you need special services, ask the providers for help/permission.  Remember, these passive DNS operators are my friends.  I don't want to have a row with them because some jerk used this library to abuse them.

If you like this library, please buy the Passive DNS operators a round of beers.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'passivedns-client'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install passivedns-client

## Configuration

From version 2.0.0 on, all configuration keys for passive DNS providers are in one configuration file.  By default the location of the file is $HOME/.passivedns-client .  The syntax of this file is as follows:

	[dnsdb]
	APIKEY = 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
	[cn360]
	API = http://some.web.address.for.their.api
	API_ID = a username that is given when you register
	API_KEY = a long and random password of sorts that is used along with the page request to generate a per page API key
	[tcpiputils]
	APIKEY = 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
	[virustotal]
	APIKEY = 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
	[mnemonic]
	APIKEY = 01234567890abcdef01234567890abcdef012345
	[passivetotal]
	USERNAME = tom@example.com
	APIKEY = 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
	[circl]
	USERNAME = circl_user
	PASSWORD = circl_pass
	[riskiq]
	API_TOKEN = 0123456789abcdef
	API_PRIVATE_KEY = 01234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstu

CIRCL also can use and authorization token.  In that case, you should drop the USERNAME and PASSWORD options and change the section to something like the following:

	[circl]
	AUTH_TOKEN = 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef

## Getting Access
* 360.cn : http://www.passivedns.cn

## Usage

	require 'passivedns/client'
	
	c = PassiveDNS::Client.new(['bfk','dnsdb']) # providers: bfk, tcpiputils, certee, dnsdb, virustotal, passivedns.cn, mnemonic
	results = c.query("example.com")
	

Or use the included tool...

	Usage: bin/pdnstool [-d [3bcdmptv]] [-g|-v|-m|-c|-x|-y|-j|-t] [-os <sep>] [-f <file>] [-r#|-w#|-v] [-l <count>] <ip|domain|cidr>
	Passive DNS Providers  -d3bcdmptv uses all of the available passive dns database
	  -d3 use 360.cn
	  -db use BFK.de
	  -dc use CIRCL
	  -dd use DNSDB
	  -dm use Mnemonic
	  -dp use PassiveTotal
	  -dr use RiskIQ
	  -dt use TCPIPUtils
	  -dv use VirusTotal
	  -dvt uses VirusTotal and TCPIPUtils (for example)
	  
	Output Formatting
	  -g link-nodal GDF visualization definition
	  -z link-nodal graphviz visualization definition
	  -m link-nodal graphml visualization definition
	  -c CSV
	  -x XML
	  -y YAML
	  -j JSON
	  -t ASCII text (default)
	  -s <sep> specifies a field separator for text output, default is tab
	  
	State and Recusion
	  -f[file] specifies a sqlite3 database used to read the current state - useful for large result sets and generating graphs of previous runs.
	  -r# specifies the levels of recursion to pull. **WARNING** This is quite taxing on the pDNS servers, so use judiciously (never more than 3 or so) or find yourself blocked!
	  -w# specifies the amount of time to wait, in seconds, between queries (Default: 0)
	  -l <count> limits the number of records returned per passive dns database queried.
	  --config[file] specifies the config file to use, instead of the default.
	  
	Getting Help
	  -v debugging information

## Writing Your Own Database Adaptor

	module PassiveDNS
		class MyDatabaseAdaptor < PassiveDB
			# override
		    def self.name
		      "MyPerfectDNS" # short, proper label
		    end
		    #override
		    def self.config_section_name
		      "perfect" # very short label to use in the configuration file
		    end
		    #override
		    def self.option_letter
		      "p" # single letter to specify the option for the command line tool
		    end
    
		    attr_accessor :debug
			def initialize(options={})
			  @debug = options[:debug] || false
			  # please include a way to change the base URL, HOST, etc., so that people can test
			  # against a test/alternate version of your service
		      @base = options["URL"] || "http://myperfectdns.example.com/pdns.cgi?query="
			  @apikey = options["APIKEY"] || raise("APIKEY option required for #{self.class}")
			end
			
			# override
			def lookup(label, limit=nil)
				$stderr.puts "DEBUG: #{self.class.name}.lookup(#{label})" if @debug
				recs = []
				Timeout::timeout(240) {
					t1 = Time.now
					# TODO: your code goes here to fetch the data from your service
					# TODO: don't forget to impose the limit either during the fetch or during the parse phase
					response_time = Time.now - t1
					# TODO: parse your data and add PDNSResult objects to recs array
					recs << PDNSResult.new(self.class.name, response_time, rrname ,
						rdata, rrtype, ttl, first_seen, last_seen, count )
				}
				recs
			rescue Timeout::Error => e # using the implied "begin/try" from the beginning of the function
				$stderr.puts "#{self.class.name} lookup timed out: #{label}"
			end
		end
	end

## Passive DNS - Common Output Format

There is an RFC, <a href='http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-dulaunoy-kaplan-passive-dns-cof-01'>Passive DNS - Common Output Format</a>, and a proof of concept implementation, <a href='https://github.com/adulau/pdns-qof-server'>pdns-qof-server</a>, that describes a recommened JSON format for passive DNS data.  passivedns-client is very close to supporting it, but since I've never enteracted with a true implementation of this RFC, I can't attest that I could correctly parse it.  I think they way that they can encode multiple results into one record would actually break what I have right now.

Right now, I'm in a wait and see mode with how this progresses before I start supporting yet another format or request that other providers start to adhere to a common output format.  If you have thoughts on the matter, I would love to discuss.
